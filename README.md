# anki-addon-1234-spacebar
Able to use 1, 2, 3 and 4 as spacebar to show the answer (flip the card) in Anki (Addon) <br>
This overrides the Reviewer._answerCard function, though it executes the old version of that function right after checking for the 1-2-3-4-as-spacebar functionality.

Put the numbered folder into your Anki addons folder (e.g. %appdata%\Anki2\addons21).

I just modified an existing anki addon, because I have no idea how to get an id/number for my addon,
because the Anki addon creation documentation is basically non-existent. (I know there are pages about how to make addons, but they don't tell you how to make addons)

If you can tell me how to make this a real Anki addon and upload it, I'd be happy to know :D
